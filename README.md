<h3 align="center">This project is a SaaS-based groupware service, developed as the final project at DDIT, and was conducted between 25 Feb and 17 Apr 2025.</h3>

My responsibilities encompass the development and design of the webhard, mail, chat, and calendar modules. 
As the UA, I was leading the front-end architecture and implementation, leveraging Bootstrap's tile-based system for the overall user interface design.
