<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Myeongji Kang</h1>
<h3 align="center">This project is a SaaS-based groupware service called 'SEPGrouppe', developed as the final project at DDIT between 25th February and 17th April 2025.</h3>

The team name 'SEPGrouppe' combines 'Sep' from September, the month we began the DDIT class, and 'Septem' (Latin for seven), representing our seven team members.

My responsibilities included the development and design of the webhard, mail, chat, and calendar modules.<br> 
As the User Agent (UA), I led the front-end architecture and implementation, utilizing Bootstrap's tile-based system for the overall user interface (UI) design.

Despite the challenges inherent in a first team project, this holds significant meaning and is something I am very proud of.

Any questions or feedback are always appreciated:)
